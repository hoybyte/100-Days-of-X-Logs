#8 Python Port Scanner and Are You old enough to Drive Program
## July 20, 2019 - Saturday
**Project**
- Python Port Scanner
- Are you old enough to drive Program

**Progress**
- Finished Python Port Scanner
- Created a basic Are you old enough drive Program


**Link to Work**


**Thoughts**
I really enjoyed learning the syntax for Python3. I see the versatility when creating the language. I am still having issues with the print statement using two variables. I will be implementing this in my next program: Death by Poison program. 

I installed Jupyter Notebooks and Anaconda Python. I am learning the shortcuts to increase work productivity; however, I still like to use Visual Studio Code. 



#7. Python Port Scanner
## July 19, 2019 - Friday
**Project**
- Create Port Scanner using Python

**Progress**
- Found a Python Port Scanner on the internet using Python 2. Converted some of the info to Python 3 syntax.

**Link to Work**


**Thoughts**
I wanted to create a port scanner using two languages. Using Python and Powershell. The port scanner using Powershell was easier for me. This is the case as I am more fluent in powershell syntax and setup being a Windows Sysadmin. However, I do like the python layout as I can run it on any machine running python. 

#6. Internal Port Scanner using Powershell
## July 18, 2019 - Thursday
**Today's Project**
-Finish Powershell script to find if ports are open on a given computer

**Progress**
-Debugged the program and fixed syntax issues

**Link to Work**
- Port Scanner Script [Port Scanner Script](https://github.com/hoybyte/100-Days-of-X-Logs/blob/master/100%20Days%20of%20Code/Projects/Port%20Scanner/Get-OpenPorts.ps1)

**Thoughts**

Coding is fun. I was excited to get the code to function without throwing errors. After reviewing the code, I found I had a logic error in an If Statement. I will fix tomorrow.

I want to implement the same task but using python.

#5. Internal Port Scanner using Powershell
## July 17, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Project**
- Create a powershell script that will accept incoming input to check for open ports on a computer

**Progress**
- Used Powershell terminal to review cmdlets that will perform the required task
- Wrote the Process Block on my Get-OpenPorts.ps1 script

**Thoughts**
Wow, it is amazing how much you forget when you stopped coding in a certain language. I forgot the syntax of the Foreach and if statements. 

After starting for 10 minutes, I remembered how to code the project. I am in the process of debugging the code, as I am not getting the desired output. 

Additional Notes:

I have decided to finish the 100 Days of code with Powershell and Python as I having a hard time being focused in Web Development. I do not like writing out paragraphs for the webpages. I would rather just find a problem and figure out a solution using Powershell or Python. I still have a lot to learn on how to use Python; however, I feel that if I challenge myself, I will pick up the language. 


#4. Create About Me HTML Page
## July 16, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Project**
- Create the About Me subpage
- Type up a small biography

**Progress**
- Created About Me page
- Did not use CSS yet

**Links to Work**
- About Me webpage [About Me Webpage](https://github.com/hoybyte/100-Days-of-X-Logs/blob/master/100%20Days%20of%20Code/Projects/Blog&Website/about.html)

**Thoughts**
I coded the about me page. I implemented my knowledge in creating the page. I did not add any css to the page yet. I have referenced the about.html page in my index.html.

I learned that web development is more than coding. It is about presentation on the pages and the quality of the writing. I have learned that I would not be a good web designer as I have a hard time articulating my thoughts in clear and concise ways. 

Additionally, I have always been a man of action. I do not want to be in management. I want to be able to use my knowledge to fix issues instead of managing people.  

Much more to do!

#3. Beginner Full Stack Web Development
## July 15, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Project**
- Complete Introduction to CSS Video Series
- Start designing website using the HTML and CSS knowledge that I have gained.
  
**Progress**
- Completed three videos of CSS training
- Started to code website and add CSS into the website "Work in Progress""
  

**Links to Work**
- Blog Website on my GitHub repository [Blog Website](https://github.com/hoybyte/100-Days-of-X-Logs/blob/master/100%20Days%20of%20Code/Projects/Blog&Website)

**Thoughts**
I know I have a long way to go on the website. It is a major work in progress. 

I Learned how to implement css into a css file and use the different type of selectors: Classes, ID, and Tags. I learned the syntax of colors and how to change the radiance and shadows. I have not implemented the changes into my files. 

I learned how to use Git when you use multiple machines to code. 

I had to re-image my laptop as I had some corruption in my OS. Do not have a lot of time to code since I had to re-image. 


#2. Beginner Full Stack Web Development
## July 14, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Project**
- Complete Chapter 1: Getting Started with HTML
- Complete Chapter 2: Introduction to CSS

**Progress**
- Completed Chapter 1 on the Udemy Course
- Watched two videos in Chapter 2: Introduction to CSS.
- Re-installing OS on laptop that I will be using

**Links to Work**
 No Work today as I had family requirements

**Thoughts**
I am trying to balance the coding journey with personal requirements. I watched videos to gain an understanding on how to effectively use HTML to create outstanding static webpages. I learned how to implant images,links,unordered and ordered lists into html files. Additionally, I learned how to create tables in HTML code. The author stated that you would have CSS or another coding language to assist with tables and formatting. 

Three ways to use CSS in HTML

- Inline
  - You would add the css language in the web file in the body of the webpage.
  - For Example:
    - body>
    - <style="Color: Red;"> This is an example </h1
    - /body>
- Internal
  - You would add the css lanage in the header tag.
  - For Example:
    - head>
    - style="Color: Red;">
    - /head>
- External
  - Best Way
  - You would control all the styles of your website with an external css file
  - For Example:
  - style.css
  - You would reference the file like: link rel="stylesheet" href="sytle.css> in this example

I am a perfectionist and I am having a hard time organizing my thoughts and ideas during this project. 

I am torn between two laptops that I have to perform this task and use as my daily driver. 

# First laptop: 
The one I am running is currently running Manjaro Linux (KDE) and I love the OS and the responsiveness to my tasks. I am currently having trouble getting my third monitor to be recognized. Specs: Dell Latitude E6530 i5 8GB memory, 640GB Hard Drive (NO SSD).

# Second Laptop:
Specs: HP Probook 450 G5, i5, 16GB 500GB SSD
I use this laptop for work and I want to seperate personal/work but I do not want to have to carry two laptops around to perform my tasks when I am at work and I have some "free time."

I am going to keep contemplating on this! In the meantime, I am going to refresh the HP Probook with a fresh copy of Windows 10: 1903 as I need to clean up the laptop.

I am going to need to learn Git some more as I am required to keep typing my password into the terminal prompt/visual studio code when pushing my commits to GitHub. I may need to research git --config to resolve this issue. 

I may create a poll to see if people are currently using Windows effectively to web develop and do not see memory issues as Windows 10 is notorious for consuming Memory. 

Possible Project: Create a Blog on my GitHub Page website. Use the existing knowledge to create a profesional looking website. 
  


#1. Beginner Full Stack Web Development
## July 13, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Project**
- Finish first chaper of Udemy Course: Beginner Full Stack Web Development
- Complete Basic HTML and HTML 5 Section under Responsive Web Design Certification on Free Code Camp
- Tweet 100 Days of Code Challenge on Twitter and post Github repository.

**Progress**
- Created first website using tutorials from Beginner Full Staff Web Development
- Learned how to reference GitHub files into markdown using Mastering Markdown.md in Github repository.


**Link to Work**
-[Reference to Website.HTML](https://github.com/hoybyte/100-Days-of-X-Logs/blob/master/100%20Days%20of%20Code/Projects/Website.html)
-[Mastering Markdown Reference](https://github.com/hoybyte/100-Days-of-X-Logs/blob/master/100%20Days%20of%20Code/Usefull%20Information/Mastering%20Markdown.md)

**Thoughts**
I learned how to properly use the basic HTML Tags into code. I learned that you should use the DoctType tag to explain what version of HTML you use. The HTML tag helps identify that you are using html as well. I learn that you insert your css entries into the header tag. Also, you can use the title tag to show the information on a browsers tab. For example, my title tag will show "Hoybyte 100 Days of Code" in my Google Chrome browser tab.  I learned that the larger the h1, h2, h3 tag is the smaller the font. h1 will create the largest heading. You use the p tag to specify a paragraph. You can use the <b>Bold</b> tag to create bold wordage or use the <em>emphasis</em> tag to create emphasis for your web page. 

I really like the markdown language in which I can collect my thoughts and use it to properly show my learning. I cannot wait to continue to my training tomorrow.
