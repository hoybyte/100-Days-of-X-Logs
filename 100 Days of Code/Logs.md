**Thoughts**
I believe the udemy course will bring extra insight to the web development as I add development into my sysadmin life. Since, I have my family onboard with the challenge, I believe I will have a better time finishing it. I will start today or tomorrow! I have a three year old so it will be difficult to add the time in my day but here is to improving my knowledge and family. Cheers!
