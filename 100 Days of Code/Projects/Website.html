            I learned how to properly use the basic HTML Tags into code. I learned that you should use the DoctType tag to explain what version of HTML you use. The HTML tag helps identify that you are using html as well. I learn that you insert your css entries into the header tag. Also, you can use the title tag to show the information on a browsers tab. For example, my title tag will show "Hoybyte 100 Days of Code" in my Google Chrome browser tab. 

            I learned that the larger the h1, h2, h3 tag is the smaller the font. h1 will create the largest heading. You use the p tag to specify a paragraph. You can use the <b>Bold</b> tag to create bold wordage or use the <em>emphasis</em> tag to create emphasis for your web page.
