        <h1>The Journey of Hoybyte</h1>
        <p>
            I started adventuring in computers during my young teens when I got the privlege to PC games. Final Fantasy VII and Wolfenstien 3D are just a few of the games I played. During this time, I learned how to nagivate the computer using control panel and command line. <br><br>

            After finishing high school, I went to pursue a Bachelors degree in Education. During my final year, I decided that I did not want to teach. I knew that I loved working with computers; so, I went to a technical college. At the technical college, I developed a love for the professional career of "Sysadmining." I worked with Windows Server 2008, Cisco Switches and the SQL programming language. I graduated within a year and went to work as a general sysadmin at a local church. We upgraded the network, implemented new IP schemes and new sites. After working for two years, I wanted to brooden my horizon, so I took at a job at a local Manage Service Provider. My knowledge grew ten-fold as I was "throw into the fire" into multiple environments such as mom/pop shops to full scale enterprises with 100 sites. I learned how to automate tasks using batch file and task scheduler. Once I heard about powershell, I started to implement more into our clients. I saw the power of automation and administrating that it can create. At the company helpdesk, I was the lead powershell guy. I used powershell to administer workstations, Windows Server, Exchange and Azure. After working there for 5 years, I was getting burnt out due to the high stress of the job. I decided to take a job at a local school system. I was hired to work in the system as an IT Specialist. I assist all schools with technology and try to implement automation whereever possible.
